Project Description
SlumRadar is a comprehensive urban health analytics platform designed to predict health risks, assess resource accessibility, and forecast slum formation in urban areas. This project leverages machine learning models to analyze key factors such as disease outbreak risk, malnutrition rates, sanitation scores, and population density. By integrating multiple predictive models, it provides a holistic view of urban health challenges and resource needs, enabling policymakers and stakeholders to make informed decisions for sustainable urban development.

Key Features
Health Risk Prediction: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to predict health risks based on environmental and socio-economic factors.

Slum Formation Prediction: Employs time series analysis to forecast the likelihood of slum formation in urban areas.

Resource Accessibility Analysis: Analyzes resource availability using clustering techniques to classify areas based on accessibility
